# Tutorial-based-projects-

This repository is a personal collection of small web projects I built while learning front-end and full-stack development by following online tutorials.

I created these projects to practice new skills, experiment with frameworks and tools, and to have working examples I can refer back to. The projects vary from static HTML/CSS/JS pages to small React apps scaffolded with Vite and a Next.js site.

## Repository structure

Each top-level folder is a separate project. Notable projects include:

- Bankist App — A bank UI tutorial project (static HTML/CSS/JS).
- Bankist Marketing Page — Marketing landing page version.
- Eat-n-Split — A small app with a build setup (check `package.json`).
- far-away — Vite + React app (see `vite.config.js`).
- react-fastPizza, react-quiz, usePopcorn, wild-oasis-dashboard-app, worldWise — React projects built with Vite.
- the-wild-oasis-website — A Next.js site (app directory + Next config files).

There are additional small demo projects and components under `src/` folders in several projects.

## How I used these projects

- Followed online tutorials and course exercises to build each app.
- Modified code to experiment with UI, state management, and APIs.
- Kept the original tutorial structure but added small personal changes and notes.

## How to run projects (general)

- Static projects (HTML/CSS/JS): open the `index.html` file in your browser or serve with a simple static server.
- Vite / React projects:

  1. cd into the project folder (for example, `far-away` or `react-quiz`).
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pnpm install`.
  3. Start dev server: `npm run dev` (or `pnpm dev`).
  4. Build: `npm run build`.

- Next.js project (`the-wild-oasis-website`):

  1. cd into `the-wild-oasis-website`.
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
  3. Run dev server: `npm run dev`.

Note: Some projects may use other package managers or have specific scripts — check each project's `package.json`.
